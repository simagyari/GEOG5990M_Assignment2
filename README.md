This repository holds the code for the final assignment of GEOG5990M at the University of Leeds.

jupyter nbconvert --inplace --to notebook --execute --allow-errors sitelocation.ipynb

Above code is to execute the notebook. It turns it into a new notebook with the nonexistent output at the same place and name, while executing it.

For documentation generating with Sphinx, the file was converted to .py with the command:
```
jupyter nbconvert testnotebook.ipynb --to python
```
